# Codebase Cleanup Results

## Removed Unused Service Files

The following service files were removed from the codebase as they weren't being imported or used anywhere:

- `src/services/bookings.service.ts`
- `src/services/destinations.service.ts`
- `src/services/events.service.ts`
- `src/services/reviews.service.ts`
- `src/services/tours.service.ts`

## Files Kept

- `src/services/profile.service.ts` - This file is used in the authentication components and must be kept.

## Analysis Summary

The current implementation uses local data files in the `src/data` directory instead of connecting to a backend service. These files provide mock data for:

- Destinations 
- Events
- Tours
- Testimonials

The project is structured to easily transition to using real services in the future, at which point the data files could be replaced with actual service calls.

## UI Components

All UI components in the component library appear to be in use throughout the application. The component system is well structured and organized into categories like:

- Buttons
- Display components
- Forms
- Navigation
- Feedback

## Next Steps

1. If backend services are implemented in the future, update the application to use real API calls instead of mock data
2. Consider implementing the removed service files when needed, connecting to the Supabase backend
3. Continue using the current pattern of UI components which is well organized and maintains good code reusability

The codebase is now more efficient and manageable with the removal of unused service files.
