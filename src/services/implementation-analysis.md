# Service Implementation Analysis

## Service Status Overview

| Service | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| profile.service.ts | ✅ Full | Connected to Supabase auth |
| tours.service.ts | 🔄 Partial | Has interfaces, uses mock data |
| events.service.ts | 🔄 Partial | Has interfaces, uses mock data |
| bookings.service.ts | 🔄 Partial | Has interfaces, uses mock data |
| destinations.service.ts | 🔄 Partial | Has interfaces, uses mock data |
| testimonials.service.ts | 📝 Placeholder | Interface only, not used yet |
| storage.service.ts | 📝 Placeholder | Interface only, not used yet |

## Implementation Details

The current architecture uses a service layer that's ready for backend connectivity but is currently using mock data for most services.

### Services That Need Updates For Supabase Integration:

1. **tours.service.ts** - Update to use Supabase queries instead of mock data
2. **events.service.ts** - Update to use Supabase queries instead of mock data
3. **bookings.service.ts** - Update to use Supabase queries instead of mock data
4. **destinations.service.ts** - Update to use Supabase queries instead of mock data
5. **testimonials.service.ts** - Fully implement using Supabase queries
6. **storage.service.ts** - Fully implement using Supabase storage

### Currently Fully Implemented:

1. **profile.service.ts** - No changes needed, already working with Supabase

## Migration Path

When connecting to Supabase:

1. Update each service implementation to use Supabase queries
2. Keep the same service interfaces to avoid breaking component code
3. Remove mock data files after services are fully implemented
4. Add proper error handling and loading states to the UI components

This approach allows for a phased migration from mock data to Supabase without major refactoring.
