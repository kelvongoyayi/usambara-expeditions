# Service Layer Analysis

## Current Implementation

Our application currently uses a hybrid approach:

1. **Services with Mock Data**: Several services (`tours.service.ts`, `events.service.ts`, etc.) exist but primarily work with local mock data from the `src/data` directory. These services have the right interfaces but aren't fully implemented to connect with a backend.

2. **Auth & Profile Service**: The `profile.service.ts` is fully implemented and connects to Supabase's authentication system.

## Service Usage Analysis

### Used Services (Partial Implementation)

These services are currently imported and used in components, but aren't connecting to a real backend yet:

- `src/services/tours.service.ts` - Used in tour management components
- `src/services/events.service.ts` - Used in event management components
- `src/services/bookings.service.ts` - Used in booking management components
- `src/services/destinations.service.ts` - Used in destinations components

### Fully Implemented Services

- `src/services/profile.service.ts` - Used for authentication and user profile management

### Unused Services

- `src/services/testimonials.service.ts` - Interface exists but not currently used
- `src/services/storage.service.ts` - Interface exists but not currently used (file upload functionality is implemented differently)

## Future Implementation Path

The codebase is designed to transition smoothly from mock data to real backend services:

1. The service interfaces are already defined and used in components
2. The Supabase migration files are ready to create the necessary database tables
3. When the backend is connected, the service implementations need to be updated to use Supabase queries

## Recommendation

Keep all service files but clearly mark them with appropriate comments to indicate their current implementation status. This will make the future transition simpler while maintaining code structure.
