# Codebase Cleanup Results

## Analyzed Unused Files

The following service files were identified as unused in the codebase:

- `src/services/bookings.service.ts`
- `src/services/destinations.service.ts`
- `src/services/events.service.ts`
- `src/services/testimonials.service.ts`
- `src/services/tours.service.ts`
- `src/services/storage.service.ts`

## Files Kept

- `src/services/profile.service.ts` - This file is used in the authentication components and must be kept.

## Analysis Summary

The current implementation uses local data files in the `src/data` directory instead of connecting to a backend service. These files provide mock data for:

- Destinations 
- Events
- Tours
- Testimonials

The project is structured to easily transition to using real services in the future, at which point the data files could be replaced with actual service calls.

## UI Components

All UI components in the component library appear to be in use throughout the application. The component system is well structured and organized into categories like:

- Buttons
- Display components
- Forms
- Navigation
- Feedback

## Next Steps

1. We've kept the service files but marked them with comments indicating they're not currently used
2. When backend services are implemented in the future, update the application to use real API calls instead of mock data
3. Continue using the current pattern of UI components which is well organized and maintains good code reusability

The codebase is now more maintainable with clear documentation of which services are currently unused but will be needed in the future.
